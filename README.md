# Student Interest in STEM vs. Non-STEM Subjects in Armenia

This project analyzes Armenian students’ interests in STEM and non-STEM subjects using participation data from subject-specific Olympiads. The objective is to investigate how student interest varies across regions and demographics, and whether STEM subjects attract significantly higher engagement.

The study uses data sourced from the official Armenian Olympiad platform (olymp.am) and applies filtering methods to reduce bias. Participation in extracurricular academic activities is treated as a practical indicator of genuine student interest.

## Research Questions
- Does extracurricular participation differ across regions?
- Are students more interested in STEM than non-STEM subjects?
- Do regional and demographic factors influence subject preference?
